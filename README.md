1. Best Hack for Social Good

    In today's society, women and gender minorities are more driven than ever to pursue careers in science, technology, engineering, and math. However, we recognize that it takes more than wishful thinking and hard work on behalf of women and gender minorities themselves to propel the demographic forward in these fields; on the one hand, contributing to women’s and gender minorities’ success in their pursuit of STEM training requires initiative from interested, everyday people who would like to reach out. On the other hand, investing in creating a social culture where supporting such innovative and ambitious people is both celebrated and normalized can lead to positively changing cultural attitudes about what ladies can do, how we perceive this demographic, and how we can all participate in lifting them up. We noticed a great opportunity to work with Wegmans, a friendly and family-oriented business, to make supporting women and gender minorities in STEM very easy to achieve. Our application rounds up the total of a customer’s purchase at Wegman’s, and donates the difference to a local organization, such as WIC, that supports women and gender minorities in STEM.
